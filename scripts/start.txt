act: page30

txt: "What kind of flowers are you?" asks a flower.
txt: "We're not flowers," says Alice as a bread-and-butterfly glides by. She doesn't seem at all surprised to hear the flower speak.
txt: "Then you must be weeds!" says a daisy. "Be off with you!"

act: page19


=== page19 ===
img: 19.png

txt: Talking flowers! Bread-and-butterflies! You've never seen anything like this in your life!
txt: But the flowers aren't very friendly, so you and Alice leave the garden and run down a tangled path.

act: page20


=== page20 ===
img: 20.png

txt: The path leads to a small beach, where a strange race is going on. It has no beginning and no end - everyone just runs around and around a rock.
txt: "Would you hold this?" asks Alice, as she hands you a little golden key. "I want to join the race."

opt: Take the key

act: page21


=== page21 ===
img: 21.png

txt: ...and when you open your eyes, you're back on the riverbank. Was it all a dream?

act: page21_1

=== page21_1 ===
img: 21.png

txt: You wonder if you can find your way back to the long hall at the bottom of the rabbit hole. You're sure this is the key that opens the door to that wonderful place!
txt: On the other hand, maybe if you just wish you were back...

opt: The End
act: title


=== page22 ===
img: 22.png

txt: After some twisting and turning, you get the cover off the cookie jar. You are so hungry that you gobble up two big cookies before you offer one to Alice.
txt: Alice is nibbling on hers when you notice that the house has gotten smaller. No! You are getting bigger! It must be the cookies!

act: page23


=== page23 ===
img: 23.png

txt: "Alice, help!" you yell, as your head pushes roof off the house. You're so big that there's no more room for Alice in the house. She runs outside and looks at you helplessly as you grow up and up.
txt: Oh, why did you eat those cookies? Why didn't you just TAKE ONE, as the label said.

act: page23_1

=== page23_1 ===
img: 23.png

txt: You look up in surprise and see a funny-looking caterpillar sitting on a mushroom.

act: page24_1

=== page24_1 ===
you: Why must we stop? We want to go THIS WAY.
caterpillar: Well, if you want to go THIS WAY, you will have to go THAT WAY to get there.
alice: But we don't want to go THAT WAY. That's why we picked THIS WAY!
caterpillar: I just told you, you can't go THIS WAY this way.

act: page25


=== page25 ===
img: 25.png

txt: You and Alice look at each other. You want to go THIS WAY, but you are afraid of making the Caterpillar mad-especially since he's so big!

act: page26


=== page26 ===
img: 26.png

txt: "But we don't want to go THAT WAY," cries Alice. "And if we can't go THIS WAY, we can't go anywhere!"
txt: "Well, that's not true at all," says the Caterpillar.
txt: "There is always a where to go to when you can't go where you want to."
txt: "Really?" you say. "Then tell us where."
txt: "Why you can go nowhere!" says the Caterpillar.
txt: You and Alice sigh and give up.
txt: "There! That's settled," says the Caterpillar.

act: page27


=== page27 ===
img: 27.png

txt: "But don't worry," he continues. "I will entertain you. I know all my multiplication tables and I'll recite them for you, one after the other."
txt: You groan and sit down.

act: page27_1

=== page27_1 ===
img: 27.png

txt: Why did you choose to go THIS WAY? Now you're stuck with a boring caterpillar who loves arithmetic.

act: detach alice
txt: You look high and low for the White Rabbit's gloves. In one room you find a closet with a heavy door. You go inside-and the door slams shut behind you. You try to open it but you can't. You're locked in!
txt: "Help!" you cry, but you know that Alice can't hear you through the thick door. You will have to open it yourself.

opt: Open the door yourself
act: page29


=== page29 ===
img: 29.png

txt: You push and pull and tug, but the door won't budge. Then, in the light that shines in under the door, you see a can of oil labeled USE ME.

act: page29_1

=== page29_1 ===
img: 29.png

txt: You squirt the oil around the door and it swings open.
txt: You rush out of the closet and out of the house, calling for Alice, but she is nowhere to be found.

act: page42


=== page30 ===
img: 31.png

txt: "Well, if you must know," says the Cheshire Cat, "THAT WAY leads to THE END."
txt: "That sounds crazy," you say.
txt: "Of course it does," answers the cat.
txt: "That's because it is crazy. Everything here is crazy."

act: page31


=== page31 ===
img: 31.png

txt: "I think we should go somewhere else," says Alice.

act: page33_1

alice: Who's Tweedledum?
you: It's such a silly name, I'm sure it's no one important.

act: page33_2

=== page33_2
img: 32.png

txt: You want to follow a path that goes through the garden, but Alice isn't sure that's a good idea.
txt: The only other path, though, leads through some thick bushes.

opt: Ignore the sign and go into the garden
act: page38

opt: Go through the thick bushes
act: page40


=== page34 ===
img: 34.png

txt: "What do you mean THAT WAY leads to THE END?" you ask the Cheshire Cat.
txt: But instead of answering, the cat starts to disappear!
txt: Soon all that is left is his grin.

act: page34_1

=== page34_1 ===

alice: Well, I've often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life!
you: Me too, and by the way, I'm more curious than ever to find out where THAT WAY leads!

act: page35


=== page35 ===
img: 35.png

txt: So you and Alice continue down the path.
txt: In a little while you come to a grove of Weeping Willow trees.
txt: Suddenly Alice stubs her toe on a rock and starts to cry.

act: page36


=== page36 ===
img: 36.png

txt: You are trying to make her feel better, when a big drop of water falls on your head. Then another... and another and another.
txt: Is it raining? No! It's the Weeping Willows. They are crying with Alice! They cry so hard they start a small flood!

act: page36_1

=== page36_1 ===

you: Stop crying, Alice. You're making the Weeping Willows cry, too!
alice: I can't, it hurts too much!

act: page37


=== page37 ===
img: 37.png

txt: You try to help her up, but now the flood of tears has turned into a small river. You and Alice are swept along like two leaves.
txt: Suddenly you hear a roar. Oh, no! There's a big waterfall ahead and you are heading right for it!
txt: "I hope this is all a dream," you say. "Otherwise going THAT WAY really is going to lead to..."

opt: The End
act: title


=== page38 ===
img: 38.png

txt: You step boldly into the garden, but Alice stands back.
txt: As soon as you enter, you feel a tug on your arm.
txt: "I'm Tweedledum," says a roly-poly little man as he pulls you out of the garden. "Keep out!"
txt: Then you feel a tug on your other arm.
txt: "I'm Tweedledee, his brother," says a look-alike man, as he pulls you into the garden. "Keep in!"

act: page39


=== page39 ===
img: 38.png

txt: You are wondering what's going on when you see the other side of the sign, the side that's facing the garden. It says KEEP IN BY ORDER OF TWEEDLEDEE.
txt: Just then, Tweedledum and Tweedledee pull at the same time. You feel as if you're stretching.
txt: You look at your arms-you are!

act: page39_1
